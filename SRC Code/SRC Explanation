We utilized python and Gephi to complete the analysis for this project.

Python:
Python was used to create a sample size of 80,000 for the twitter dataset in order to have around the same
sample size for all social platforms.

Gephi:
Gephi is a network analysis tool that can intake large network datasets and 
create visuals as well asperform statisical analysis on them. To use gephi,
we clicked on "New Project" then from the menu bar we clicked on "Data Laboratory" 
and there is an option labeled "Import Spreadsheet" that allowed us to 
directly imported the datasets either as a csv or excel file. After importing the data,
we clicked on "Overview" to see the inital graph. To improve the visual, we chose to use
the OpenOrd algorithm from the layout drop down menue and ran the software again to 
show the new visual with the selected layout. We kept the default setting for the layout. 
To run statistical tests, we clicked on the statistics tab and run the statistics for 
average clustering coefficient and average path length.
