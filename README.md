## Contents
This repository contains materials relevant to DS 4002, "Data Science Project Course", 
this project aims to assess social networks on social media platforms. It will be looking
at three platforms: twitter, facebook, and reddit. Through these platforms will examin
how connections are made.This repository will include the source folder, data used, figures produced, and 
references that were used. 

### SRC Section

Installing Data into software:
To run the analysis we will be using the software Gephi. The three datasets can be downloaded
from SNAP, we wil be using the following data sets: "facebook_combined.txt.gz", "twitter_combined.txt.gz",
and "soc-reddditHyperlinks-title.tsv". Once these datasets are downloaded they will need to be converted to 
excel or csv to be be used on Gephi.

Usage the Software: 
Once the datasets have been converted to excel or csv, they can be directly imported to a workspace on Gephi. After
importing the dataset, you will select the OpenOrd algorthim layout and running different statistical tests.
